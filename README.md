# ChargeIt

## Overview

The goal of the Smart Grid project is to integrate a photovoltaic (PV) array, a storage device, and an external grid with dynamic buy and sell prices into an intelligent energy management system. With the use of real-time data on irradiance, demand, and energy prices from a server, the system must manage deferrable and immediate loads while remaining profitable. The main task is creating an optimal algorithm that can meet these specifications while beating a na√Øve approach that disregards profit margins. 

ChargeIt is a web application designed to manage and track the charging status of electric vehicles. It provides real-time updates, historical data, and efficient management tools for EV owners and operators.
